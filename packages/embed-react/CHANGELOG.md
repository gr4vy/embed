# v2.5.0 (Wed Dec 22 2021)

### Release Notes

#### Add support for transactionCancelled event ([#49](https://github.com/gr4vy/gr4vy-embed/pull/49))

Adds support for `transactionCancelled` event. This event occurs when a buyer explicitly cancels a transaction. This could be before/or after the transaction is created. This is currently not supported for cancelling transactions during 3-D Secure.

# v2.4.0 (Thu Dec 16 2021)

### Release Notes

#### feat: support for optional form ([#46](https://github.com/gr4vy/gr4vy-embed/pull/46))

Form is no longer a required prop, but `onComplete` should be used. This allows a merchant to have more control over how their own form is submitted.

#### fix: embed does not re-render when props change ([#45](https://github.com/gr4vy/gr4vy-embed/pull/45))

Embed React will now re-render on prop changes. This uses React `memo` with a deep comparison of props so nested objects, such as `theme` will still cause a re-render if changed.

# v2.0.0 (Thu Nov 18 2021)

### Release Notes

#### Change environment usage to point at different URLs ([#39](https://github.com/gr4vy/gr4vy-embed/pull/39))

The `environment` property can now only be set to either `production` or `sandbox`. The `sandbox` value is a new value that replaces both the `development` and 'staging` values that were previously used. The `environment` variable will now be used to connect to the right Gr4vy instance.
